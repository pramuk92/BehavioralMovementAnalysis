Behavioral Data Analysis: Group Comparisons and Time Series Visualization
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook for analyzing behavioural recording data, specifically aimed at grouping and visualizing movement data over time. The script:

Reads and cleans behavioural recording data from an Excel file.
Segments data into customizable groups and time intervals.
Plots time series graphs with mean distance moved and error bars across time points for each group.
Generates bar charts and performs statistical analysis, including ANOVA, Tukey's HSD, and t-tests, to compare groups based on movement metrics.
This code is useful for visualizing time-based movement data and testing for significant differences between groups, with flexibility for user-defined group names, time points, and statistical tests.

Note: This repository contains two sample Excel files with data from a behavioural recording from Noldus Daniovision. Also, attached are screenview of the steps for data retrieval using a specific format. There is a photo of how fish are being tracked by the software. :)
